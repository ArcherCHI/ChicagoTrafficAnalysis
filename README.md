This program is used to analyze data from Chicago's Red Light and Speed Cameras from July 1, 2014 - November 28, 2024.
Whether you would like to see how many violations were caught on a specific date, or even the an entire year, this program can get you an accurate result.
If you would like to see how many violations are caught at a specific intersection, this program can do it too!

This program uses Python for the functionality of the program as a whole, but uses an SQL imported library to search up queries for data based on user's input,
as well as Matplotlib for plotting the aforementioned data when prompted.

I am unable to include the database used in this program because it is quite too big of a file, but it can be downloaded at https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Red-Light-Camera-Violations/spqx-js37/about_data
and https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Speed-Camera-Violations/hhkd-xvj4/about_data
